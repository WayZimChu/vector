Vector is an interface to find a place to meet between two points of location.

Time spent: **1** mythical man hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can get current location
- [ ] User can get input a friend's location & get a midpoint
- [ ] User can get friends location from a list of friends
- [ ] User can choose the type of meeting point (ex: bar, coffee shop, library).
- [ ] User can pull a list of businesses around a radius of the meeting point.
- [ ] Users can access detailed view of midpoint location(s)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can adjust midpoint based on time and/or distance
- [ ] User can can choose method of transportation.
- [ ] Friends locations update based on their GPS location

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using Google Map API
2. Integrating multiple API datasets into a single "stream" of user info
